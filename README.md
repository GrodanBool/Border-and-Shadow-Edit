# Outrun Theme
 A theme for the Steam Deck folowing the Outrun/SynthWave/RetroWave/Cyberpunk color scheme, currently it applies system wide, although i might have missed a few things. 
 
 The following themes are not required by the Outrun theme but they do complement it well:
 
 - Switch Like Home
 - Round
 - Obsidian
 
 Here's also a Boot Video made by u/Perfect_Aim and together with the Night Shift keyboard layout they really complete the look.
